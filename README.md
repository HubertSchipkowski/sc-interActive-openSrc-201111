 ###### Separation of Modes when Creating Texts

Inspired by the idea of the separation of modes that Bret Victor talked about, i.a. here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdP2Bmieg and based on personal experiences, a text creation process functions best when one separates the mode of creating texts from the mode of proofreading them.  

Consequently, it would make sense to separate these two modes not only timely but also physically by device.  

Therefore the use case scenario for this software system is that the actual writing happens on a desktop/laptop computer and the proofreading on a mobile touch device.
